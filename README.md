GTK theme providing a consistent look for GTK2 and GTK3, based on the classic "Raleigh" theme.

The GTK2 part uses the built-in "Raleigh" theme, but explicitly declares all of its colors to facilitate color changes (see ./gtk-2.0/gtkrc).
The GTK3 part is based on "raleigh-reloaded" (https://github.com/vlastavesely/raleigh-reloaded) but has been modified in order to be more consistent to the GTK2 theme.

This project also includes a theme for the XFCE Window Manager (xfwm4), which is based on the "Redmond" theme, as well as a theme for the XFCE notification system (xfce-notify-4.0).
